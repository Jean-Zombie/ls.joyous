What's new
==========

ClosedForHolidaysPage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A recurring event page can now have a closed for holidays page added to it.
This indicates that event does not occur on holidays.  All holidays
or a specific list of holidays can apply.
Named ClosedForHolidays pages are listed just like named Cancellations.

Holidays
~~~~~~~~
 * Joyous holidays can now be added together.
 * The setting that is parsed for Holidays can be changed from JOYOUS_HOLIDAYS.
 * Holidays can be passed to API functions and RecurringEvent to ensure
   everyone is using the same definition of holidays.

iCal
~~~~
 * When we are closed on holidays these are exported as EXDATES.

RSS
~~~
 * Named ClosedForHolidays pages are listed just like named Cancellations.

Other features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * There is a new DateExceptionBase class that CancellationPage,
   PostponementPage and ExtraInfoPage inherit from, but ClosedForHolidaysPage
   does not.
 * New getLocalTimeAtDate function.
 * RecurringEventPage._getMyFirstDatetimeTo() now takes an optional myFirstDt
   argument to save from calculating this again.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
 * When _getFromTime takes an atDate it is in the local time zone.




 x Record no authority to update an exception as an iCal load failure
   FIXME also record exceptions as successes?!?!
